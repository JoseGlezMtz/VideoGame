        <p>Forest Adventure is a Trading Card Game 
            made by three students inspired by the 
            popular Disney series Gravity Falls where 
            you get the chance to select your team and
            defend the campsite! Forest Adventure" is
            a TCG that tells the story of our seven
            characters trying to defend their camp
            which is suddenly invaded by creatures
            from another dimension.... themselves. 
            Our campers and staff have the responsibility
            to defend the camp at all costs with the
            help of multiple power ups and each other. 
            Join Chef, Wendy, Brick, Lumberjack, Coach,
            Mike and Lifeguard on their epic adventure!
